# How to do this code review exercise

- One of your fellow front-end developers has just written this code and sent it to you for a code review.
- You probably won't be able to actually "run" any of this code, but
assume that it's functional, and meets the Acceptance Criteria (though there
may be some edge-case bugs. (hint, hint)).  In a code review you are commenting on both how
it was implemented, and looking for any errors.
- There's some real rookie mistakes here.  But don't assume that this was
written by a jr. dev who needs feedback on only the most important problems.
Assume that this was written by a sr. dev who is just working in a new area
(e.g. a back-end dev who doesn't write much JS).  i.e. tell me all the
problems.
- Don't make changes to the code itself.  Instead send us your comments about 
the code.
- Ignore the commit log.  We occassionally make improvements to these samples to help 
keep you focused on the real problems and not to get distracted by things that just aren't clear. 
Only look at the code.
